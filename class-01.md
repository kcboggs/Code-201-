# Intro     

*Many books that teach HTML and CSS resemble dull manuals.
To make it easier for you to learn, we threw away the 
traditional template used by publishers and designed
this book from scratch.*  

# The Structure of this book  
*In order to teach us about web pages, this book was divided
into three sections:*  
1. HTML   
2. CSS     
3. Practical  

# How people access the web    
*Before looking at the code used to build websites
it is important to consider the different ways in which
people access the web and clarify some terminology.*    
- Browsers  
- Web servers  
- Devices  
- Screen Readers  

# How websites are created   
*All websites use HTML and CSS, content management
systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms
which often add a few more technologies in the mix.*  
- What you see  
- How it is created  
- HTML5 & CSS3  

# How the Web Works  
*When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be 
anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the 
web server, your browser will first connect to a DOmain Name System
(DNS) server.*
