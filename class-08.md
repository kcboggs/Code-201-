# Layout  
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and  
help to describe its structure.  
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple < div > elements).  
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are  
block-level elements.  
- To make HTML5 elements work in internet explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra   
JavaScript is needed, which is avaiable free from google.
