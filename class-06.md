# Object Literals  
_Ojects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a  
something you would recognize from the real world. in an object, variables and   
functions take on a new name._  

+ In an object variables become known as properties  
+ Functions become known as methods  

Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.  
You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation.  
You can also access properties using square brackets.  

# Creating an object: Constructor notation  
- The new keyword and object constructor create a blank object. You can then add properties  
and methods to the object.  

# Updating an object  
- To update the value of properties, use dot notation and square brackets. They work on  
objects created using literal or constructor notation. To delete a property, use the delete keyword.  

# Document object model  
_DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JaveScript can access and update  
the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window._  

- The browser represents a pae using a DOM tree  
- DOM trees have four types  of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.  
- You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.  
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will return a NodeList.  
- Form and element node, you can form and access its contents using properties such as textContent an innerHTML  
or using DOM manipulation techniques.  
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements rhat are siblings of eachtoher.  
- In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).  
- Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
