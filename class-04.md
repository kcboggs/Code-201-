# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions  

# Links  

- Links are created using the <a> element.  
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.  
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.  

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab  
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)  
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame  
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window  
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame 

# Layout  

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page  
- The float property to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-colum
- layouts (floated items require a defined width).
- Grids help create flexible and professional designs.  
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.   

# Functions, Methods, and Objects  
*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts 
of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather then repeating the same set of statements).* n 

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {  
  // code to be executed  
}
