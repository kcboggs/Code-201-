# Images  
- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page. You must alwyas specify an src attribute  
to indicate a source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image. Photographs  
are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# Color  
 - Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.  
 There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.  
 Color pickers can help you find the color you want.  
 It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color  
 (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).  
 CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.  
 CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacicty value. It is known as HSLA.
  
 # Text  
 - There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style and spacing. There is a limited  
 choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed. There are several options if you want  
 to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.  
 To can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned  to the 
 left, center, right or justified. It can also be indented. You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an  
 element when a user hovers over or clicks on the text, or when they have visited a link.
