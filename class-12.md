# Docs for the HTML < canvas > Element & Chart.js

# Basic usage  
*The < canvas > element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦).  
These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. When no styling rules are  
applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.*  

<b>Fallback content</b>  
*The < canvas > element differs from an < img > tag in that, like for < video >, < audio >, or < picture >  
elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting  
it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always  
provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.*

*Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the  
< canvas > element. Browsers that don't support < canvas > will ignore the container and render  
the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support < canvas > will ignore the content inside  
the container, and just render the canvas normally.*
