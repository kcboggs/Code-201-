# Tables  
- The table element is used to add tables to a web page.  
- A table is drawn out row ny row. Each row is created with the < tr > element.  
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or < th > if it is a header).  
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and the colspan attributes.  
- For long tables you can split the table into a < thead >, < tbody > and < tfoot >.
