# About Me

I was born and raised on an unincorporated territory of the Unites States called Guam. I moved to Louisiana in 2000 there I worked as a dental assistant full time and Walmart part time for about 4 years. I moved to Georgia in 2004 and lived there for about 10 years while in Georgia I worked for a company that was contracted through the military for around 5 years. After that contract phased out I was hired at one of the local hospitals while earning my BS in Information Technology and Systems Management. Soon after graduation in 2014, my family and I relocated to Bellevue, WA which is where we still live at today. I currently work as a Slots Systems Technician for the Snoqualmie Casino and now I am here at Code Fellows hoping to become a future developer.
